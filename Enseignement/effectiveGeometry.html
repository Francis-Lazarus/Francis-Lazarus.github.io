<b>Where and when:</b> Room A2 at ENS-Lyon, on Thursday from 1:30pm to 4:30pm
<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Nothing strictly required. Basic notions of differential geometry will help.
</p>
<p>
<b>Objective:</b> The course Effective Methods in Geometry is rather
unusual in aiming to show how abstract mathematics can be translated
into concrete computations. A wide set of methods will be presented,
ranging from combinatorial ones to optimal transport. Many examples
will be given: isometric embeddings, word
problems and computational topology, optical lenses...
A first step in this translation requires to discretize the studied problem that may comes from mathematics itself or from other fields such as physics. We shall see on various examples how to perform this discretization and how to solve the corresponding formulation.
<p>One part will focus on numerical aspects. We shall concentrate on some equations of the Monge-Ampère type that intervene in many fields such as geometry, optimal transport, or optics. We will show how the geometrical discretization of the theory of optimal transport leads to solving optimization problems. In turn, this approach may lead to the realization of concrete objects, such as optical lenses.
</p>
<b>Tentative plan for this part:</b>
<ol>
  <li> Theory of optimal transport:
  Monge problem, Kantorovitch relaxation, Kantorovitch duality, notion of $c$-conjugate, the Wasserstein distance, Mac Cann interpolation.
</li>
<br>
  <li>Optimal transport for discrete measures:
 assignement problems, auction algorithm, entropic regularization.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>Optimal transport  between a measure with density and a discrete measure:
 connection with computational geometry (Voronoi diagrams, Laguerre diagrams, ...), the Oliker-Prussner algorithm, concave formulation and Newton's methods.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>Applications to inverse problems in anidolic optics.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Another part will focus on combinatorial aspects issued from topology and geometry, where the underlying mathematical problems have a discrete nature. We will start with the isometric embedding of the flat torus in order to explore PL isometric embeddings as well as other questions mixing topology and geometry.
</p>
      <b>Tentative plan for this part:</b>
<ol>
  <li> The theorem of  Burago and Zalgaller for PL isometric embeddings of polyhedral surfaces.
</li>
<br>
  <li>Effective aspects on the existence of topological embedding.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>What we cannot compute: how the undecidability of the Word problem impacts computational topology.
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Validation:</b> Oral presentation on a research article followed by questions on the part of the course not covered by the article.

<!-- 
<p>

<b>Oral presentation:</b> You have to select one project in the list below. We recommend that you choose a partner and work by pairs on a project. Each project should be chosen by at most one pair. Try to avoid conflict by discussing your choice with the whole class.

The presentation should last <b>25</b> mn followed by questions and a short discussion. You may use your own laptop or bring your presentation on a usb key. In this latter case, we ask you to use a pdf file. Each member of a pair should speak approximately the same amount of time. The rough idea is to present the main ideas in the chosen article(s), give some details and say one proof that you find worth be presented. We do not require a written report for the project, but <b>we will ask for an electronic copy of your slides</b>.

Some papers are only accessible via your institution. We nonetheless link each paper to a public version so that you get an idea of the content. When indicated, you should download the final version in the end. Please, send us an email if you have any problem to download a paper.
