</p><p><b>Résumé</b>

</p><p align="justify">
In these three talks I will describe three ideas all pertaining to the
analysis and computation of optimal packings of cylindrical tubes
centred on arbitrary space curves. While I will not mention the
specific applications in any detail, the problem of cylindrical tubes, or
fattened lines, arises in a variety of biological contexts, for example
packing of DNA into the capsid head of bacteriophages, and the helical
form of many bacteria and other simple organisms.
<br><br>
The first idea is that of global radius of curvature, which is a
method of characterizing the normal injectivity radius (or informally
thickness) of a given space curve.
<br><br>
The second idea is that of biarcs, which are a way of approximating
arbitrary space curves with arcs of circles. The biarc discretization
combines very well with the approach of global radius of curvature in the
computation of thickness.
<br><br>
The third idea is the specific optimal packing problem of ideal knot
shapes. Here I will explain the problem, and then show approximately ideal
shapes of trefoil and figure-eight knots that were computed via a Monte
Carlo code that exploits global radius of curvature and the biarc
discretization.
